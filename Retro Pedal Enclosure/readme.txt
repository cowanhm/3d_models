1. Enclosure printed with PETG in two halves 
     Glass w/ Aqua net unscented
     90C Bed Temp
     250C Nozzle Temp

2. Pedal components from eBay / flyboy_222pa
     Comma Pedal w/ Molex connectors flashed for Honda
     Honda aftermarket harness

3. Screws #6-2" drywall screws 3X

4. Schematic for wiring - refer to discord

5. For my openpilot-pedal, Molex connectors were removed, and wires soldered to board.  
   Also tested continuity of each wire from pin to board.  
   Inspect with 10x magnifier to ensure all solder connects are flowed properly.  
   Retest continuity once enclosure is screwed together.

6. Testing – Do not turn on vehicle ignition without car’s harness connecter 
   plugged into either accelerator or pedal enclosure + accelerator.  
   Do not plug in ethernet interconnect yet.  
   Start vehicle and test accelerator for normal operation.  
   If not working correctly reconnect car’s harness directly to accelerator and diagnose wiring issues.  Retest

7. After manual accelerator test, connect openpilot-pedal to y-splitter with short ethernet cable.  
   Refer to openpilot discord for pedal usage.

IMMEDIATLEY DISCOUNTINUE USE if ANY RISK is created to you or the public.
