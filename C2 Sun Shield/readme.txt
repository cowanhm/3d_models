1. Use 3D material which has low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   In warmer conditions, differences in CTE with tape may induce warping
     PETG - seems to print well enough on glass w/ Aquenet.
     ABS tg=105C (not tested)
     PLA tg=60C (not tested)

2. Apply relective heating tape to flat side of shield
   My technique: lay on flat surface, smooth flat with minor tension along tape, peel tape backing
   Align 3D print, and carefully roll shield onto tape.  Smoth out. Trim excess.

3. Optional: remove punch-outs for cord or power-button
