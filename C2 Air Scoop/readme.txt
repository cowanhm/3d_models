1. Use 3D material which has low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   In warmer conditions, differences in CTE may cause pins to shear off
     PETG - seems to print well enough on glass w/ Aquenet.
     ABS tg=105C (not tested)
     PLA tg=60C (not tested)

2. To attenuate reflective sound, apply layer of aborbing material on inside
   Cut pattern using anechoic.pdf as pattern
   Spray 3M contact cement to inside before pressing material into place
